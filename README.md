Build Together is a platform for developers to collaborate on projects and help each other build something amazing!

It has Ruby on Rails API backend. and React and Redux front end, and SqLite relational database persistence.

To get started,
- Clone the repo. 
- cd in to build-together-api and run bundle install and launch rails server.
- cd in to build-together-client run npm install to install dependancies and launch server with npm start.

I have recently introduced Sass css preprocessor to build-together-client. 

- cd in to build-together-client and run the following this command - npm run watch-css

This will start a watcher that will find every Sass file in src directory and create a corrosponding CSS file next to it.
